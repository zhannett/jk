															<h1>Lea-ann belter has been making beautiful gowns for a select group of brides for close to two decades.</h1>													
															<div class="col1">
																	<p>As a top student of fashion, nominated for numerous design awards, Lea-Ann Belter trained with a couturier before opening her first custom gown boutique in Toronto's exclusive Yorkville area. She has since extended her reach and made her gowns available in specially-chosen stores across North America and Europe as well as in her flagship boutique located on Queen Street East in Toronto. Lea-Ann's sophisticated designs and attention to quality and detail have drawn the most discerning brides and a high-profile clientele.</p>
																	<p>Since her start in 1989, Lea-Ann has been committed to elegant simplicity in design. Sophisticated lines and understated details distinguish her gowns from the ordinary. Belter does not follow trends, she sets them. Belter is adamant about quality. To ensure a perfect fit, she requires more measurements than any other designer. She refuses to have her gowns manufactured off shore because she must oversee the workmanship herself. Each gown is entirely reverse-stitched and fully lined in silk. The fabric touching your skin during the most important day of your life is as fine and soft as the fabric your gown is crafted in — you could really wear the gown inside out if you wanted to.</p>

															<div class="col2">
																	<p>The details of a Lea-Ann Belter gown do not dazzle, they seduce. Hand-sewn pearls, Austrian crystals and soft delicate embroidery whisper softly of taste and elegance. Lea-Ann works closely with her textile mill in India and has even designed some of her own fabrics such as beautiful silk brocades and softly colored dupioni silks.</p>
																	<p>Brides across the world seek out the beautifully crafted Lea-Ann Belter collection for a myriad of reasons - simple and elegant designs, incredible attention to detail, workmanship equal to or better than that of the creations from the runways of Paris. Lea-Ann Belter’s wedding designs are simply beautiful.</p>
