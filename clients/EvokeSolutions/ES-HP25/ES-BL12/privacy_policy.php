We endeavour to limit our requests for personal information to information we believe is minimally necessary to achieve our stated collection purposes. Personal information collected on this Web site is often limited to e-mail address, country or location but may include additional information when needed to provide a service you requested. For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping such as name, address, telephone number and credit card number.</p>
												<p>Also, in order to improve our services and the quality of the Web site, Blink Logic offers you the opportunity to provide your suggestions and contributions by completing a Contact Us form which collects personal information such as name and e-mail address.

													<p>Blink Logic occasionally hires third parties to provide certain services available on our Web site or made available on our behalf. We will only provide those third party providers the personal information they need to deliver their services, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Blink Logic may provide your personal information to partners who work on behalf of or with Blink Logic under partner or confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Blink Logic communicate with you about products and/or services from Blink Logic and our partners.</p>
													<p>Blink Logic may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
													<p>Blink Logic may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on Blink Logic, protect and defend the rights or property of Blink Logic and its family of Web sites or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Blink Logic employees, users of Blink Logic products or services, or members of the public.</p>
													<p>Blink Logic reserves the right to transfer personal information to third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p>
													<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, in the applicable Terms of Use Agreement or at the time we request the information; Blink Logic does not otherwise use, sell, rent, share or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties.</p>

											<dt>Information about You from Third Parties.</dt>
											<dd>
													<p>In order to protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p>
													<p>Under some circumstances such as registering your business to subscribe to services from us, we may conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet. If you incur a debt to us, we will generally conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. We, at our sole discretion, also reserve the right periodically to retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report for any account, and reserve the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.</p>

											<dt>Use of Non-Personal Information Collected.</dt>
											<dd>
													<p>Blink Logic uses non-personal information such as demographic data to analyze and develop marketing strategy and to determine how you found about us, your interests regarding our products and services and how to further improve this Web site based upon user data. We may share such non-personal data with third parties.</p>

											<dt>Opt-Out.</dt>
											<dd>
													<p>We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular basis via email, and we may also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We may use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.</p>
													<p>Blink Logic provides you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on this Web site or if you do not want us to share your personal information with third parties.

											<dt>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</dt>
											<dd>
													<p>Blink Logic uses &quot;cookies&quot; and other tracking technologies. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small text file that may be used to collect information about Web site activity. For example, when someone visits the Web site, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Web site previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site.</p>
													<p>Blink Logic uses an email delivery and marketing third party provider to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at this Web site to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Web site.</p>
													<p>If you have agreed to receive emails from us, those emails may contain advertising about goods and services that we think might be of interest to you. In order to understand how our readers interact with the emails and the content that we send, we use pixels in the text in order to understand who has opened the emails that they have been sent. In order to provide our content in the most interesting way, we also use pixels to learn whether you can receive emails in text or html form. If you click on a link in the email, we may set a cookie on your browser. If you visit this Web site as a result of clicking on a link, we are able to understand how you interact with the pages of our Web site through the combination of the cookie and pixels set on the pages of our Web site. This enables us to understand what interested you in our emails and what did not, and what interests you about our Web site and what does not. We can then try to send you more interesting information in the future. Please note that this information is for our use only; we do not disclose or share this information with any third parties.</p>
													<p>Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics.</p>

													<p>Security.</p>
													<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
													<p>If Blink Logic learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. Blink Logic may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the Blink Logic.com web site. Blink Logic may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
