				<p>Dann&eacute; methodology, treatments and products have helped change the face of aesthetics.
				Unlike animal and petroleum by-products found in many over-the-counter skin care programs, Dann&eacute;
				botanical formulations work with the skin rather than merely acting on it.  Amino acids, and other
				proteins, enzymes and fractionated oils from the plant world are used to create an environment that
				allows the skin to thrive.</p>
				
				<p>The Dann&eacute;	<b>Remove</b> - <b>Rebuild</b> - <b>Protect</b> - <b>Maintain</b> System matches
				individual body chemistry within the appropriate botanical formulations, professional treatments and
				home prescriptives.  Regardless of ethnic background, gender, age or skin condition, Dann&eacute;
				offers an effective program for all skin types.</p>

				<p>The <b>Remove</b> - <b>Rebuild</b> - <b>Protect</b> - <b>Maintain</b> System is a comprehensive <b>four-step</b>
				program designed to:</p>
				<img class="header" src="./images/remove.gif">
				<p>Remove dead skin cell build-up, which leads to the appearance of dry skin, fine lines and skin discoloration.<br>

					<p><b>Enzyme treatments are essential</b></p>

					<p>Excessive dead cell buildup is associated with skin conditions like hyperpigmentation, blemishes,
					 fine lines, acne, sun damage and basic aging.  To remove this build up, Dann&eacute; offers an
					exclusive series of enzyme treatments.</p>

					<p>These <b>enzymes</b>, activating proteins, <b>are natures biological catalyst</b>.  They consume
					dead cell material, clean out debris and gases in the cells, exercise facial muscles, open up the vascular
					system by bringing new oxygen to skin cells, and encourage the formation of fresh elastin and collagen. Dann&eacute;
					enzyme treatments tighten, tone and firm the skin.</p>

					<p>Enzymes can also be used in conjunction with other Dann&eacute; formulations to create customized treatments
					for individual skin conditions.  A variety of treatments are offered including basic and advanced therapies for
					acne, scarring, hyperpigmentation, depp & fine wrinkles and aging, just to name a few.</p>	

					<p><b>Pro alpha has many benifits</b></p>

					<p>For those wishing an aggressive therapy, <b>deeper, more dramatic removal</b> and toning is achieved with the Pro 	
					Alpha series of treatments.  <b>Pro Alpha &mdash; and exclusive blend of plant and fruit sugar acids</b> is not a
					a &ldquo;Quick Fix&rdquo; peel but rather a system of professionally applied treatments that remove dead skin 
					cells and instigate rapid collagen developement in the skin.</p>

					<p>One to six Pro Alpha treatments are medically considered to have an <b>effect similar to laser treatments or deep
					medical peels, without the risk of trauma</b>, long convalescence or possible contra-indication sometimes associated
					with these procedures.  The is no loss of skin colour or sharp lines of demarcation around the face with Pro Alpha
					treatments.</p>

					<p>All Pro Alpha treatments are preceeded with and followed by enzyme treatments.</b>

					<p><b>Home Therapies</b></b>

					<p>Regardless of treatment, it is important to continue the effects of the enzyme action at home.  Daily
					use of one of the Dann&eacute; home prescriptive cleansers will continue the exfoliation process, stimulate cell
					turnover and maintain the skin's pH balance.</p>
	
					<p>Weekly use of the home prescriptive enzyme masque will further aid what was accomplished with the professional
					treatment.</b>

				<img class="header" src="./images/rebuild.gif">
                <p>Rebuild the remaining living cells by providing protein, other amino acids and nutrients, thus enabling
				the cells to stay alive longer and perform at their healthiest, youngest level.<br>
                <a class="tellMore" href="javascript:toggleText('rebuildDetails');">Tell me more&hellip;</a></p>
                <div class="toggledText" id="rebuildDetails">
					<p>Post treatments following dead cell removal begin the actual rebuilding process.  The Dann&eacute; Rebuilding
					System uses the body's own regenerative powers and a complementary combination of moisturizers and nourishers to
					achieve outstanding results.</p>

					<p><b>Normalizing the skin's pH</b></p>

					<p>Nature's only true moisturizer is called the <b>acid mantle</b>.  Supported by the bi-layer lipids, it is a
					blend of secretions from the sweat gland and oil from the sebaceous glands.  As a part of the rebuilding process,
					these glands must be imitated on a daily basis.</p>
					
					<p>The Dann&eacute; method utilizes two carefully formulated products that &ldquo;mock&rdquo; these secretions
					to instantly restore and maintains the precious acid mantle.  Composed of fractionated oils and herbal water, these
					products penetrate softly into the epidermis, providing immediate natural skin tone and moisture all day long.</p>
				
					<p><b>Nourishment</b></p>

					<p>Another important component of the Dann&eacute; Rebuilding System are the <b>transdermal cr&eacute;mes</b>
					which moisturize and nourish the skin.  All cr&eacute;mes are water-soluble and store deep in the voids of the
					skin for hours allowing living cells to draw off their nutrients as needed.  These products offer all essential 
					vitamins, minerals, proteins and amino acids required to kiip skin cells healthy.  Although many skin cr&eacute;mes
					and lotions offer similar ingredients, it is <b>the special Dann&eacute; delivery system</b> that produces 
					startling rejuvenating effects.  No other cr&eacute;mes &ldquo;tighten&rdquo; the appearance of the skin like
					Dann&eacute; formulas.</p> 
                </div>

				<img class="header" src="./images/protect.gif">
                <p>Protect the skin from sun, free radicals, glycosylation and other environmental factors.<br>
                <a class="tellMore" href="javascript:toggleText('protectDetails');">Tell me more&hellip;</a></p>
                <div class="toggledText" id="protectDetails">
					<p>Free radicals from pollution, improper eating habits, cosmetics and over exposure to the sun are the main
					precursors of rapid aging.  The Dann&eacute; concept is unparalleled in providing protection from environmental
					factors with <b>powerful, super antioxidants known as pychnogenols</b>.  A main key to the Dann&eacute; cell
					protection system for nearly 30 years, these powerful protectors are complex organic plan compounds found in
					fruits, vegetables and certain tree barks.  <b>Pychnogenols from the absorbable vitamin C family, grape seed
					extracts and other botanicals are important components of most Dann&eacute; treatments and home prescriptives.</b></p>
				
					<p><b>Protection from the Sun</b></p>
					<p>One of the most important skin protectors is sunscreen.
					Dann&eacute; Sunblock is on of our proudest offerings to the public and skin professionals.  Non-oily and
					transdermal, Dann&eacute; Sunblock offers sun radiation protection for several hours, depending on your tolerance
					to the sun, without feeling greasy or heavy.  Dann&eacute; Sunblock is designed to be worn over any of the other
					Dann&eacute; cr&eacute;me products or under heavy make-up, without interfering with the benefits and nutrients
					of any Dann&eacute; products your Paramedical Dermal Technician may prescribe.</p>

					<p><b>Protection against Aging</b></p>

					<p>Excess glucose, or sugars in the skin cause protein bond to break down and push the skin cells into trauma
					called glycosylation.   Glycolysation leads to &ldquo;cross linkage&rdquo; or severe, deep wrinkles usally
					seen in the cheeks, forehead or around the mouth of mature men and women.  This action can be prevente if
					caught early, and slowed if the symptoms are already present.  The Dann&eacute; Concept offers a new breakthrough
					call &ldquo;Aminodine Spray&rdquo;.  In Europe, the Dann&eacute; therapists call this spray 
					 &ldquo;Gold Water&rdquo;</p> because its powers are observed almost overnight, particularly on persons who are
					smokers or who work in a smokers environment.  Aminodine Spray is recommended for nighttime use applied under
					Dann&eacute; Firming Cr&eacute;me, our flagship  &ldquo;Super Antioxidant&rdquo;.  This provides you with a double
					power packed home treatment to offset the ravages of glycosylation.</p>
