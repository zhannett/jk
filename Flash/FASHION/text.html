<p><b>Coming Next Month:</b></p>
<p>classic red lips, smoky eyes, and rouged cheeks, made easygoing for the real world. Plus, breakthroughs for breakouts, and the most flattering haircut for everyone (hint: It's not the bob). There is no denying that this season provides us with the greatest challenge: how to keep cool without losing our sense of style. Most of us have no intention of spending the hot season in shorts and T-shirts. Mixing sexiness with sophistication offers a look for grown-up women. And as appealing as these animal prints are, it is best to use them in tops and in small doses. Paired with a pencil skirt, the look stays on the right side of appropriate day and night.</p><br>

<p><b>What changes do I need to make to my makeup bag?</b></p>
<p>Summer lends itself to more sheer makeup. Banish your heavy foundation (unless you cannot live without the coverage) and use a tinted moisturizer or sunless tanner. As a firm believer in concealer all year round, it may be time to get a shade darker depending on how much you tan (or self-tan). Ask any counter to help you choose the right shade. I love a little bronzer dusted where the sun would normally kiss the skin. A dark mascara may be all you need on your eyes (plus some shimmer for evening). On lips, my favourite is a gloss or tint, specially something with an SPF.</p><br>

<p> <b>Do I apply sunscreen before or after my moisturizer?</b></p>
<p> Sunscreen is most effective when it mixes with your skin proteins, so apply it to clean skin right before your moisturizer. Be sure to put it on face, eyelids, ears and neck (a lip balm or lipgloss with an SPF works better for the lips) and follow the directions for applying.</p><br>

<p> <b>How do I combat humidity and oils that cause my makeup to smudge? And how can I get my makeup to last longer?</b></p>
<p>Try waterproof makeup. On cheeks, go for a powder blush or bronzer over a cream version. If you tend to sweat off your makeup easily, use a sunless tanner, powder blush, waterproof mascara, cream shadow stick and lipgloss—all should have good staying power. </p>

<p><b>How can I keep my mascara from running under my eyes?</b></p>
<p> Do not put on too much eye cream. If the area is too creamy, the makeup will slide right off. Also, concealer should be finished with a bit of powder to help dry out the eye area. </p>
