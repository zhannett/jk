				<p class="dear">Dear Sir/Madam:</p>
				<p>I am extremely interested in a position of a Web Developer that is open in your company. I have enclosed my resume for your review and consideration.</p>
				<p>I am an expert in front-end web development (HTML/XHTML/DHTML, CSS1/CSS2, JavaScript/DOM-scripting, XML/XSL). I have experience with server-side scripting (PHP3/4/5, VB Script, JSP, ASP.NET) and technologies (ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, OOD, and RDBMS), some experience in designing databases and back-end development (MySQL, MS Access, and MS SQL Server, Oracle). I have hands-on experience with web design software (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator).</p>
				<p>My background is University Degree in Electrical Engineering and College Diploma in e-Commerce. I am hardworking, self-motivated and flexible. I am comfortable working independently or in a team environment. The enclosed resume highlights my education and work experience. As well, I am able to learn new procedures quickly and would emphasize my ability to cope well under pressure, adapt readily to the demands of irregular work schedules and to interact effectively with clientele, superiors and co-workers.</p>
				<p>Your communication and the opportunity of a personal interview with you at your convenience would be most appreciated. I can be reached at (416) 929-4372 (home) or (416) 841-4372(mobile) and will return messages within six hours. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
				<p>Yours truly, </p>
