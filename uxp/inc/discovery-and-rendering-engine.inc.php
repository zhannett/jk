<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Communications service providers require dynamic user experience (UX) presentation capabilities in order to deliver relevant, integrated and personalized experiences to their users.   With a growing number of device and application combinations, service providers will benefit from an engine that assists users in discovering the availability of services, and also drives a specific user experience tailored to that user's subscribed services.</p>
<p>The Connected Experience Platform's Discovery and Rendering Engine is a full application platform that is user aware, prompting users to register and enable new and existing service offerings on new devices to power the Connected Experience.</p>
<p>Once the connected user discovers services, the UX rendering engine presents convergent service consoles on various devices (tablet computers, smartphones, interactive televisions), remaining service-aware, able to dynamically render modified interfaces based on an end user's changing preferences and subscriptions.</p>
